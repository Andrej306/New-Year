<h2>I have met them at close of day<br>  
Coming with vivid faces<br>
From counter or desk among grey <br>  
Eighteenth-century houses.<br>
I have passed with a nod of the head<br>   
Or polite meaningless words,  <br> 
Or have lingered awhile and said <br>  
Polite meaningless words,<br>
And thought before I had done <br>  
Of a mocking tale or a gibe <br>  
To please a companion<br>
Around the fire at the club,   <br>
Being certain that they and I<br>   
But lived where motley is worn:<br>   
All changed, changed utterly:<br>   
A terrible beauty is born.<br>

That woman's days were spent <br>  
In ignorant good-will,<br>
Her nights in argument<br>
Until her voice grew shrill.<br>
What voice more sweet than hers,<br>  
When, young and beautiful,<br>   
She rode to harriers?<br>
This man had kept a school<br>   
And rode our wingèd horse;<br>   
This other his helper and friend<br>   
Was coming into his force;<br>
He might have won fame in the end,<br>   
So sensitive his nature seemed, <br>  
So daring and sweet his thought.<br>
This other man I had dreamed<br>
A drunken, vainglorious lout.<br>
He had done most bitter wrong<br>
To some who are near my heart, <br>  
Yet I number him in the song;<br>
He, too, has resigned his part<br>
In the casual comedy;<br>
He, too, has been changed in his turn,  <br> 
Transformed utterly:<br>
A terrible beauty is born.<br>

Hearts with one purpose alone<br>   
Through summer and winter seem <br>  
Enchanted to a stone<br>
To trouble the living stream.<br>
The horse that comes from the road,<br>   
The rider, the birds that range<br>   
From cloud to tumbling cloud,<br>  
Minute by minute they change;<br>   
A shadow of cloud on the stream <br>  
Changes minute by minute;<br>   
A horse-hoof slides on the brim,<br>   
And a horse plashes within it;<br>   
The long-legged moor-hens dive, <br>  
And hens to moor-cocks call;<br>   
Minute by minute they live:<br>   
The stone's in the midst of all.<br>

Too long a sacrifice<br>
Can make a stone of the heart. <br>  
O when may it suffice?<br>
That is Heaven's part, our part<br>   
To murmur name upon name,<br>   
As a mother names her child <br>  
When sleep at last has come<br>   
On limbs that had run wild. <br>  
What is it but nightfall?<br>
No, no, not night but death; <br>  
Was it needless death after all?<br>
For England may keep faith<br>   
For all that is done and said. <br>  
We know their dream; enough<br>
To know they dreamed and are dead;<br>   
And what if excess of love<br>   
Bewildered them till they died?<br>   
I write it out in a verse—<br>
MacDonagh and MacBride<br>   
And Connolly and Pearse<br>
Now and in time to be,<br>
Wherever green is worn,<br>
Are changed, changed utterly:<br>   
A terrible beauty is born.<br>
